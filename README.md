# Projects
All of the projects I've worked on during my academic career are collected in this repository, along with all training sessions or hackathons I've attended and particpated in. These projects serve as a portfolio of my expertise in a range of programming languages and technologies.

Based on their technology stack, the projects in this repository are separated into many categories, such as web development, machine learning, etc. Each project has a separate folder with thorough instructions, source code, and any other necessary materials.

Feel free to browse this repository whether you wish to hire me or just learn more about my work. I hope my projects are interesting to you. Contact me at tallurianthyush02@gmail.com if you have any inquiries or comments.

We appreciate your visit to my projects repository. My projects will undoubtedly show my capacity to provide effective and high-quality solutions.
