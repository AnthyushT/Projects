The project "Social Media Trends" is a web-based application. The project aims to provide real-time data on current Twitter trends and provide users with the ability to search for specific trends. The project is built using Node.js and utilizes the Twitter API to retrieve the latest trends data.

The user interface of the application is simple and intuitive, allowing users to easily view the latest trends based on the location, provides users with information such as the trend name, tweet volume.One of the key features of the project is the use of the WOEID (Where On Earth ID) parameter, which is a unique identifier for any location on the Earth. The API uses the WOEID to determine the trending topics for a specific location. This allows users to retrieve the trending topics for a particular country, city, or even neighborhood.
