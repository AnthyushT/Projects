## Optimizing Facebook Ads with Thompson Sampling and Upper Confidence Bound

Facebook ads optimization is a process of refining ad campaigns to reach the desired goal and maximize profit for a business. 
This can be done through a variety of methods, one of which is using the Thompson Sampling and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithms.

For this project, a dataset of existing Facebook ad campaigns is selected, and preprocessing is done to analyze the data and create a model to optimize future campaigns. 
Thompson Sampling and UCB are two reinforcement learning algorithms that we worked on to optimize decisions in an uncertain environment while minimizing the expected costs. 

- Thompson Sampling relies on a Bayesian approach to determine the best action based on prior data and an exploration-exploitation strategy. This means it takes existing data and uses it to estimate the probability of success for each action. 

- UCB follows the same basic principles, but also incorporates a “confidence bound” to ensure that the most promising action is selected.

The two algorithms are then implemented on the dataset to optimize future ad campaigns. 
The results showed that both algorithms were successful in optimizing future campaigns, with Thompson Sampling performing slightly better than UCB. 
This project demonstrates how these two algorithms can be used to help businesses create more efficient ad campaigns and maximize their profits.
