The "NEWS CLASSIFICATION USING NLP" project involves building a machine learning model to classify news articles as genuine or false.This project aims at building a model which classifies whether the news given is genuine news or false news by using Natural Language Processing, NLP techniques such as text pre-processing (tokenization, stemming, and stopword removal), vectorization, and usage of libraries like NLTK and scikit-learn.

The model has be trained on a dataset(Fake and True) of news articles using supervised learning techniques such as the Passive Aggressive Classifier and Logistic Regression.

The performance of the model has been evaluated based on various metrics such as accuracy, precision, etc. This project is aimed at developing a model that can accurately classify news articles in real-time and help people avoid falling for fake news.
