## NEWS CLASSIFICATION USING NLP
- This project aims at building a model which classifies whether the news given is genuine news or false news by using Natural Language Processing, NLP techniques such as text pre-processing (tokenization, stemming, and stopword removal), vectorization, and usage of libraries like NLTK and scikit-learn.

- The model has be trained on a dataset(Fake and True) of news articles using supervised learning techniques such as the Passive Aggressive Classifier and Logistic Regression.

- The performance of the model has been evaluated based on various metrics such as accuracy, precision, etc. This project is aimed at developing a model that can accurately classify news articles in real-time and help people avoid falling for fake news.
